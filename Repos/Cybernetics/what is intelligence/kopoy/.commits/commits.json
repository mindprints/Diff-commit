Limits are often undisclosed and dynamic, based on credits or usage quotas that refresh every five hours to prevent abuse, with higher tiers (Pro/Ultra) offering priority access and more generous allowances.​\n\nChecking Access\nLog in via one.google.com/ai or the Antigravity app/dashboard to view your subscription status and available creddits (e.g., 200 for Plus, 1,000 for Pro, 25,000 for Ultra). These apply mainly to features like Flow/Whisk but correlate with Antigravity quotas; Free tier has basic access with tighter caps.​\n\nMonitoring Limits\nNo direct usage meter exists in official docs, but users report checking via browser extenzions showing quota percentages or by testing runtime (e.g., run for an hour and measure depletion). Quotas scale with task complexity—simpler prompts allow more usage—and reset periodically; track via Google Cloud billing if concerned about overages.​​",
