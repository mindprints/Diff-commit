# ⚠️ DEPRECATED

**This folder contains development artifacts and is no longer in active use.**

The Fact Checker feature has been **fully implemented** and integrated into the main application:

- **Service**: `services/factChecker.ts`
- **Types**: `types.ts` (FactClaim, VerificationResult, etc.)
- **UI Integration**: `App.tsx` (AI Edit dropdown menu)
- **Model**: `constants/models.ts` (Perplexity Sonar Pro)

## What was this folder?

This folder contained iterative development prototypes and planning documents for implementing the AI Fact Checker feature. Now that the feature is complete and released in **v1.1.0**, these files are kept only for historical reference.

## Files here should NOT be modified or used.

All bug fixes and enhancements should be made to the files in the main project directories listed above.
