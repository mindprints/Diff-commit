When first opening the program, a user will clear the instruction examples and either paste text into the left tab or the right tab, or begin writing in either tab. In either case, no AI functionality is immediately available. This is not optimal. AI functions should be available from the start.

Clicking 'Compare Versions' will not, at this stage, cause AI function buttons to appear. Only when there is text in both tabs will 'Compare Versions' open up the Read, AI Edit, and Copy buttons. The logic behind this is obvious—we cannot 'compare' unless there are two versions.

Since we want AI functionality from the get-go without the necessity of having text in both tabs, the 'Compare Versions' button at this stage is not optimal.

Now, let's imagine that the user only has text content in the left tab and the AI buttons are showing. What should happen? The AI edit should be carried out, and the results presented in the right tab with diffs shown in the left tab.

If the user begins their session by writing in the right tab and executes an ai function. the text currently in the right tab should be moved to the left tab and the results of the AI intervention placed in the right tab. Now the diffs from the intervention will be shown on the text in the left tab. And the right tab has the new processed text. 

those diff markings show that a comparison is being made - no need for a comparison button. 

But what happens if a user starts by entering two versions of a text in each tab. the diffs should imidiatley be shown in the left tab. No need for a compare button there either.
