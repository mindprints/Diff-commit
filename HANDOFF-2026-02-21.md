# Diff-commit Handoff (2026-02-22)

## Scope Completed Today
- Continued universal graph replacement work and polished interaction quirks.
- Added project quick actions (delete), repo-level controls (`New Project`, `Merge`, sort dropdown).
- Restored + improved merge workflow in universal graph (Ctrl/Cmd+click ordered selection).
- Added prompt renaming support in the main editor prompt-edit flow (3-tier prompt format).
- Designed and scaffolded repo-level “NotebookLM-style” repo intelligence system.
- Implemented working V1 repo intelligence pipeline:
  - repo indexing (project contents only)
  - lexical retrieval
  - redundancy scan (exact + lexical overlap)
  - grounded model calls for summarize/ask/topic map
  - minimal UI panel (`RepoIntelPanel`)

## Current Behavior (End-of-day)

### Universal Graph (`src/renderer/components/UniversalGraphModal.tsx`)
- Dragging a project to another repo:
  - moves the project
  - flashes the target repo zone
  - **stays on the source repo view** (no auto-switch)
- Hover tooltips render above surrounding project pills (z-index fix).
- Project pills now support:
  - hover trash icon (delete)
  - double-click to open in editor (restored and reliable)
  - Ctrl/Cmd+click multi-select for merge (selection order preserved)
- Header controls now include:
  - `New Project`
  - `Repo Intel`
  - `Merge` / `Merge (N)` (enabled when 2+ selected)
  - `Sort` dropdown (`Sort by Name`, `Sort by Date`, `Reset View`)
- Merge creates a merged project from selected projects in selection order and opens it in editor.

### Project Manager / Universal Graph coordination
- `New Project` from universal graph opens `ProjectsPanel` **on top of** the graph.
- Project manager opened from universal graph starts directly in create mode (no extra click).
- Canceling project manager returns to universal graph.
- Creating/loading project exits universal graph and returns to main editor.

### Prompt editing in main editor
- Prompt edit mode in `EditorPanel` now uses 3 sections:
  - `PROMPT NAME:`
  - `SYSTEM INSTRUCTION:`
  - `TASK:`
- Saving prompt edits updates prompt name as well (rename support).
- Parser remains backward-compatible with older 2-section prompt edit content.

### Repo Intelligence Prototype (`RepoIntelPanel`)
- New repo-scoped analysis UI is available (opened from universal graph).
- Supports:
  - Build/refresh index
  - Summarize repo
  - Ask repo
  - Find redundancy
- V1 index/retrieval scans repo project contents (`content.md`) only.
- Redundancy report currently uses exact hash + lexical token overlap (Jaccard).
- Repo summarize/ask/topics now use grounded OpenRouter model calls with retrieved excerpts in prompt.
- Citations list is retrieval-derived (top retrieved chunks), not yet parsed from exact `[C#]` references in model output.
- Renderer fallback path exists if running app has stale preload without `window.electron.repoIntel` (preload/main restart still recommended).

## Major Files Touched (Today)
- `src/renderer/components/UniversalGraphModal.tsx`
- `src/renderer/components/AppModals.tsx`
- `src/renderer/components/ProjectsPanel.tsx`
- `src/renderer/components/PromptGraphModal.tsx`
- `src/renderer/components/EditorPanel.tsx`
- `src/renderer/components/RepoIntelPanel.tsx` (new)
- `src/renderer/services/repoIntelService.ts` (new)
- `src/renderer/contexts/RepoIntelContext.tsx` (new)
- `src/renderer/hooks/useRepoIntel.ts` (new)
- `src/renderer/contexts/UIContext.tsx`
- `src/renderer/contexts/index.tsx`
- `src/main/repoIntelIndexService.ts` (new)
- `src/main/repoIntelIpc.ts` (new)
- `src/main/index.ts`
- `src/preload/index.ts`
- `src/renderer/electron.d.ts`
- `src/shared/repoIntelTypes.ts` (new)
- `README.md`

## Known Quirks / Follow-up
- Repo intel citations are currently retrieval-based, not exact model-output citation parsing/validation.
- Repo intel cost tracking is not yet wired into `AIContext.updateCost`.
- Repo intel indexing is in-memory only for now (no persisted cache yet).
- Repo intel retrieval is lexical only (no embeddings/hybrid ranking yet).
- Universal graph repo zone dragging still uses window mouse listeners and could be refactored/polished.
- No commit/diff pills in universal graph yet (still deferred).

## Validation Run Today
- `npx tsc --noEmit` (passing after changes)

## Suggested Next Steps (Tomorrow)
1. Repo intel hardening:
   - persist repo index cache to disk
   - parse/validate explicit `[C#]` citations from model output
   - wire cost logging/session cost updates
2. Repo intel UX:
   - add `Map Topics` button to `RepoIntelPanel`
   - show index stats (sources/chunks/status) in panel
   - add open-project action from redundancy rows
3. Universal graph merge UX:
   - optional clear “selection mode” hint / keyboard affordance text
   - optional deselect-all action
4. Universal graph roadmap:
   - commit/diff lane integration and quick actions
